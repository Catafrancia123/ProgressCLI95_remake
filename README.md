# ProgressCLI95_remake
The continuing of the official [ProgressCLI95](https://github.com/Delta-Code-Repository/ProgressCLI95), But since the code is **TERRIBLE** I decided to recode and remake the entire game from scratch.

Trello: [here](https://trello.com/b/af6IZl6X/progresscli-rewrite-stuff)

## Game Jam
This is also part of the [PBcord Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/pbcord-game-jam). Try joining it!

## Important message to testers:
1. Run the setup.py file before starting the game by running the boot.py file.
2. For language translators, please do not delete any quotation marks, curly brackets, newlines, etc.
